A Prime Number Generator up to 10^27.
© 2012 Michael M. Ross

Output prime values in a selected range to text files.

1. Save the program (PrimeGen.exe) to a folder.
2. Specify From and To values.
3. Select the range (number of values*) for each text file.
4. Click Start.

The first number is the sequential rank; the second number is the prime; the third number is the interval from the previous prime. (For example, 60, 281, 4 means 281 is the 60th prime number and the previous prime is 277.)

*The default of 100,000 means that prime numbers within that range up to the To value will be written to each file. The size of files in any range will diminish with magnitude, as the frequency of prime numbers decreases.
